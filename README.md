# ChatVault Exporter

## Release Checklist

Run the release gate before uploading a Chrome Web Store package:

```bash
npm run release:check
```

The package script writes a clean extension bundle to `dist/extension/` and a ZIP named `dist/chatvault-exporter-<version>.zip`. The bundle is generated from an allowlist so `site/`, `supabase/`, `tests/`, `node_modules/`, old ZIPs, and local metadata are not included.

Before submitting to Chrome Web Store:

1. Confirm `manifest.json`, `package.json`, and the release ZIP filename use the same new version.
2. Confirm the production Chrome Web Store extension ID has a matching Google OAuth redirect URI.
3. Configure `CHATVAULT_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` with the official site, supported AI platform origins, and exact Chrome extension IDs. Do not use `chrome-extension://*`.
4. Deploy pending Supabase migrations and Edge Functions, then smoke test checkout, webhook entitlement sync, restore purchase, and the 3-export free limit.
5. Complete Chrome Web Store privacy/data-use disclosures for account email, user ID, subscription state, and non-content analytics events. Chat bodies are not uploaded or stored.

## OAuth Redirects

The extension manifest includes a fixed public `key` so local unpacked builds keep a stable Chrome extension ID:

`cjkfchfnmbhcpmbhobdanongbjkcbagj`

The Chrome Web Store upload package must not include `key`; `npm run package` strips it from `dist/extension/manifest.json` while keeping the source manifest stable for local OAuth testing.

Register this exact Google OAuth redirect URI on the Google OAuth client configured in `src/supabase-config.js`:

`https://cjkfchfnmbhcpmbhobdanongbjkcbagj.chromiumapp.org/`

Current Google OAuth client ID:

`666614439104-f4hlm7c2vsdk9kepnmbgsk1olqca0n9s.apps.googleusercontent.com`

For production, also register the Chrome Web Store extension ID redirect URI on that same Google OAuth client:

`https://<chrome-web-store-extension-id>.chromiumapp.org/`

Do not reuse competitor or placeholder Chrome Web Store IDs in OAuth configuration.
